As an expert in Cypher Query Language and Memgraph graph database, please help me with generating VALID Cypher queries.

# Important considerations:

## Node connectivity, nodes are connected with the following relationships
```
(:Pod)-[:ClaimsVolume]->(:PersistentVolumeClaim)
(:StatefulSet)-[:Manages]->(:Pod)
(:ReplicaSet)-[:Manages]->(:Pod)
(:StorageClass)-[:UsesProvisioner]->(:Provisioner)
(:Pod)-[:RunsOn]->(:Node)
(:IngressServiceBackend)-[:TargetsService]->(:Service)
(:Host)-[:IsClaimedBy]->(:Ingress)
(:PersistentVolumeClaim)-[:BoundTo]->(:PersistentVolume)
(:Service)-[:Selects]->(:Pod)
(:EndpointAddress)-[:ListedIn]->(:Endpoints)
(:EndpointAddress)-[:IsAddressOf]->(:Pod)
(:PersistentVolume)-[:UsesStorageClass]->(:StorageClass)
(:Ingress)-[:DefinesBackend]->(:IngressServiceBackend)
(:Deployment)-[:Manages]->(:ReplicaSet)
```
## Rules for Cypher query generation
When generating Cypher queries, follow these rules:
1. Variable Usage:
Always reference variables directly, without square brackets.
- Correct: p['status']['phase']
- Incorrect: [p]['status']['phase']
2. Filtering:
Use only the WHERE clause for filtering nodes or relationships. Do not use WITH ... WHERE or other filtering mechanisms.
3. Property Names:
Always use single quotes (') around property names when accessing properties, especially if they may contain special characters.
- Correct: p['status']['phase']
- Incorrect: p[status][phase] or p["status"]["phase"]
