As an expert in Cypher Query Language and Memgraph graph database, please help me with generating VALID Cypher queries.

# Important considerations:

## Node connectivity, nodes are connected with the following relationships
```
(:Pod)-[:ClaimsVolume]->(:PersistentVolumeClaim)
(:StatefulSet)-[:Manages]->(:Pod)
(:ReplicaSet)-[:Manages]->(:Pod)
(:StorageClass)-[:UsesProvisioner]->(:Provisioner)
(:Pod)-[:RunsOn]->(:Node)
(:IngressServiceBackend)-[:TargetsService]->(:Service)
(:Host)-[:IsClaimedBy]->(:Ingress)
(:PersistentVolumeClaim)-[:BoundTo]->(:PersistentVolume)
(:Service)-[:Selects]->(:Pod)
(:EndpointAddress)-[:ListedIn]->(:Endpoints)
(:EndpointAddress)-[:IsAddressOf]->(:Pod)
(:PersistentVolume)-[:UsesStorageClass]->(:StorageClass)
(:Ingress)-[:DefinesBackend]->(:IngressServiceBackend)
(:Deployment)-[:Manages]->(:ReplicaSet)
```
## Data filtering
When filtering nodes, always use WHERE, always use bracket Notation `[]` to access property instead of Dot Notation `.` and always use property name in `'` to avoid problems with special chars
